# Twitch Emoticon Grabber - Dec 2018 Update
## Had to make some updates to the tool to reflect new twitch endpoints, but the end-goal is the same

A tool written in Python 3 to grab all twitch emoticon images in their highest resolution and download them into a folder.

The folder are organized by set #'s. From what I can tell, the "None" folder houses all global emotes.

It's normal to have some errors produced by filenames with regex strings.

Currently downloads 291MB,~74,000 files.
